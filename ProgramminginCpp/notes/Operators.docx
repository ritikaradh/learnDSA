1.      Constants:
            Variables that cannot be changed.

            //must be initialized
            const int n = 25;
            const float PI = 3.14;

            //not allowed
            const int n;
            n = 25;

            ->  Difference btw Macros and Const:
                
                Macros:
                    ->  defined with #
                    ->  no space is reserved in the memory, so no need to define the datatype.
                    ->  value is fetched at compile time.

                Const:
                    ->  defined with const keyword.
                    ->  space is reserved in the memory, so need to define datatype.
                    ->  value is fetched at runtime.

2.      Typecasting:
            Conversion of data from one type to another.

            ->  Implicit Conversion or Type promotion done by compiler to avoid data loss.

            ->  Explicit Conversion done by user.

            ->  bool < char < int < float < double

3.      Operators:
            i.      Arithmetic Operators
                        a.  Binary arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %)
                        b.  Unary arithmetic operators (++, --)
            ii.     Assignment Operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=)
            iii.    Relational Operators (>, >=, <, <=, ==, !=)
            iv.     Logical Operators (&&, ||, !)
            v.      Bitwise Operators (Detailed in Bitwise Manipulation)
