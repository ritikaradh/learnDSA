How does code run?
    code -> compiler -> code.exe -> "Hello World" 
        Source Code -> Compiler -> Executable File -> Output

Preprocessor Directive
    ->  Header Files
            #include <iostream>

            all preprocessor directive starts with #.

            Header Files include pre-written code that's required to execute our program.

            E.g., iostream, vector etc.

    ->  Macros
            Symbolic constants
            
            E.g., #define PI 3.14

Main Function
    ->  Starting point of execution.
    ->  Only single main function in a program.

Namespace
    using namespace std;
    or,
    std::cout<<"Hello World";

    ->  Standard C++ Namespace is called std.

    ->  define vs declare

    ->  <<endl can be used for '\n'

Varibles:
    ->  If we just declare a variable in C++ and doesn't assign any value to the variable.
            e.g., int a;
            
            Then the C++ automatically assigns any GARBAGE VALUE to this variable.

DataTypes in C++:
    ->  Primitive Types:
            i.      Integer(int)                    4 Bytes
            ii.     Character(char)                 1 Byte
            iii.    Boolean(bool)                   1 Byte
            iv.     Floating Point(float)           4 Bytes
            v.      Double Floating Point(double)   8 Bytes

    ->  Non-Primitive:
            i.      String
            ii.     Array etc.,.

    ->  Note:   1 Byte = 8 bits (where, bits = 0,1)

Comments in C++:
    ->  Same as C.

Taking Input in C++:
    int age;
    cout<<"Enter Age";
    cin>>age;
